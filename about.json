    "bio": "I am a Front End Developer with a background in culinary. I realized my passion for tech when I started building and troubleshooting computers in 2016. Through this experience, I was able to develop a deep skill set in a short amount of time. This inspired me to learn more about tech and enroll in to General Assembly. Iâ€™m looking to launch a career in Front End Development and work as a junior role/intern with an innovative team. I see myself in an organization that values growth and potential."
